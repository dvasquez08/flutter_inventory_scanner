# Flutter Inventory Scanner

A new Flutter project.

## How It Is Going to Work

This app is going to be integrated with a Firestore database. The main purpose of it will be to use a barcode scanning function to lookup items in an 
inventory which is stored in Firestore, and if no item is found it will add it to the Firestore database.
